# Autonomous Sensor Data Processing Stack

## üöó Project Overview

This project aims to build a modular and real-time sensor data processing pipeline for autonomous driving applications. The system collects data from various sensors (e.g., LiDAR, camera, IMU, GPS), synchronizes the data using timestamps, and forwards it to a central compute unit such as a **Jetson Nano** or **Jetson AGX Xavier**.

The project is implemented using **ROS** (Robot Operating System) and **Python**, and is designed to run on real embedded hardware as a home robotics and learning project.

## üß† Learning Goals

- Gain hands-on experience with ROS and sensor drivers
- Learn to interface with real-world sensors
- Implement time synchronization and data logging
- Understand and build a scalable data acquisition stack for autonomous systems
